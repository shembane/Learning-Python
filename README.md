# Learning-Python

##In a nutshell

This repository contains my exercise scripts and supporting documents as I learn Python.

##About this repository

The exercises are from the "[Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)" book by Zed A. Shaw.

I've been working through the book, doing the exercises and study drills. This repository contains my practice exercises and my notes that I write as I go.

The notes are really just for me but feel free to give feedback if you see a mistake or if I have misunderstood any concepts. I'm really just trying to figure this stuff out and become a competent programmer.

I tend to look for answers on Stack Overflow whenever I get stuck (like many programmers and learner programmers, I'm sure) so I have included references to useful answers and questions I find in my notes too.
