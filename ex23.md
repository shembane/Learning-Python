The purpose of this exercise is to read through Python code and try to understand what the code says, making notes of unfamiliar code to research later.

I chose this repository: "[Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform)". I selected this file to read through: "[python-docs-samples/blog.py at master Â· GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/blob/master/blog/introduction_to_data_models_in_cloud_datastore/blog.py)"

## Code to research further

* `enumerate()`
* `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` <!-- Seems to be a datetime function that references UTC time -->

<!-- Continue with another repo for the next coding session -->
